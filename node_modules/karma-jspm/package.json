  "readme": "# karma-jspm  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Workiva/karma-jspm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Workiva/karma-jspm)\n\nkarma-jspm includes the jspm module loader for karma runs. This allows dynamic loading of src/test files and modules. No longer do you need to worry about browserifying your src or tests before every test run!\n\n##Installation##\n\nAvailable in npm: `npm install karma-jspm`\n\n**This plugin assumes you are using jspm in your project.** You will need to have a `config.js` in the root of your project (though this is configurable) as well as a `jspm_packages` directory containing systemjs and the es6-module-loader.\n\n##Configuration##\n\n*karma.conf.js*\n\nInclude this plugin in your frameworks:\n\n```js\nframeworks: ['jspm', 'jasmine'],\n```\n\nKarma auto loads plugins unless you specify a plugins config. If you have one, you'll also need to add it there:\n\n```js\nplugins: ['karma-jspm', 'karma-phantomjs-launcher'],\n```\n\nThe `loadFiles` configuration tells karma-jspm which files should be dynamically loaded via systemjs *before* the tests run. Globs or regular file paths are acceptable. \n\n\n**You should not include these in the regular karma files array.** karma-jspm takes care of this for you.\n\n```js\njspm: {\n    // Edit this to your needs\n    loadFiles: ['src/**/*.js', 'test/**/*.js']\n}\n```\n\nThat's it!\n\n\n###Optional Configuration###\n\nYou may have named your jspm `config.js` file or `jspm_packages` directory something else. In this case simply add that to the jspm configuration in *karma.conf.js*:\n\n```js\njspm: {\n    config: \"myJspmConfig.js\",\n    packages: \"my_jspm_modules/\"\n}\n```\n\nYou may want to make additional files/a file pattern available for jspm to load, but not load it right away. Simply add that to `serveFiles`. \nOne use case for this is to only put test specs in `loadFiles`, and jspm will only load the src files when and if the test files require them. Such a config would look like this:\n\n```js\njspm: {\n    loadFiles: ['test/**/*.js'],\n    serveFiles: ['src/**/*.js']\n}\n```\n\nBy default karma-jspm ignores jspm's bundles configuration. To re-enable it, specify the `useBundles` option.\n\n```js\njspm: {\n    useBundles: true\n}\n```\n\nDepending on your framework and project structure it might be necessary to override jspm paths for the testing scenario.\nIn order to do so just add the `paths` property to the jspm config object in your karma-configuration file, along with the overrides:\n \n```js\njspm: {\n    paths: {\n        '*': 'yourpath/*.js',\n        ...\n    }\n}\n``` \n",
